17 moves currently added:

One feature I would like to have is for the gyms to each be like facilities in the battle frontier.
* 1st Gym: Little Cup
* 2nd Gym: Battle Factory
* 3rd Gym: Battle Tower
* 4th Gym: Inverse Battles
* 5th Gym: Monotype

## Completion

This project is no where near completion. What I do have nearly completed is the pokedex. All of the pokemon's front sprites have been inserted in the game with only a fex backsprites needed. All base stats and level up moves have been completed. Evolution requirements for some pokemon still need to be completed.
